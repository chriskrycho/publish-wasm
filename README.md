# Test Repo for a GitHub Pages Action

This is a completely uninteresting repo for iterating on what I need to have a minimal HTML page with a link to a current download for a [dprint][dprint] plugin used with [rust-lang/book][book] while waiting for a particular [bug fix][PR] to be merged and released.

[dprint]: https://dprint.dev
[book]: https://github.com/rust-lang/book/
[PR]: https://github.com/dprint/dprint-plugin-markdown/pull/130
